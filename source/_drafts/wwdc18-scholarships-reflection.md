- 没这打算/放弃了/没赶上 deadline/总之没申请
- 没提交符合要求的作品

1. The judges want *very* interactive, "tutorial-styled" playgrounds this year, and "utility-styled" playgrounds just don't work as well.
2. This year's application is just generally more competitive than last year. Last year there were a ton of Brazilian applicants and not as much Chinese or Indian applicants, and this year the situation reversed.
3. 去年录米勺奥巴马视频那件事
4. 今年更注重某些 themes，比如 diversity, exotic culture, accessibility, etc.
5. 我 written response 里某些事对 judges 来说是扣分项
6. "在某个特定的 condition 下100% crash" 扣了很多technology 分
